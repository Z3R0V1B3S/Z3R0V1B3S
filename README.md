# Hey there, I'm Z3R0V1B3S ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm an easygoing individual who finds joy in fumbling around various creative pursuits. <br>
While I may seem lazy at times, I firmly believe that every stumbling block is a stepping stone to greater things.


## Interests
- ðŸ’» Coding: Despite my casual approach, I find delight in coding and exploring different technologies, languages, and frameworks.
- ðŸŽ§ Music: the art of the soul's expression.
- ðŸŽ¬ Blender: With a laid-back attitude, I experiment with Blender to create 3D characters, worlds, and immersive animations.
- ðŸš€ I'm always excited about personal projects and side hustles, embracing each opportunity to grow.


## Fun Fact
- ðŸ˜„ Most of my projects are like treasures collecting dust on a shelf, but I'm determined to change that and finish what I start.
